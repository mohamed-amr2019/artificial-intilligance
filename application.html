    <td>In agriculture</td>
    <td> Here’s an alarming fact, the world will need to produce 50 percent more food by 2050 because we ’re literally eating up everything! the only way this can be possible is if we use our resources more carefully. Organizations are using automation and robotics to help farmers find more efficient ways to guard their crops from weeds. Blue River Technology has developed a robot called See & Spray which uses computer vision technologies like object detection to monitor and precisely spray weedicide on cotton plants. Precision spraying can help prevent herbicide resistance.</td>

    <td>In health care</td>
    <td>When it comes to saving our lives, a lot of organizations and medical care centers are counting on artificial intelligence. There are many samples of how AI in healthcare has helped patients all over the world. Similarly, Aifloo is developing a system for keeping track of how people are doing in nursing homes, home care, etc. the best thing about AI in healthcare is that we don’t even need to develop a new medication. Just by using an existing medication in the right way, we can also save lives.	</td>

  <tr>
    <td>In space exploration</td>
    <td>Space expeditions and discoveries always require analyzing vast amounts of data. Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning is the best way to handle and process data on this scale. After rigorous research, astronomers used Artificial Intelligence to sift through years of data obtained by the Kepler telescope in order to identify a distant eight-planet solar system.</td>
