Artificial intelligence: the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly related to intelligent beings. The term is usually applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, like the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. Since the development of the digital computer within the 1940s, it's been demonstrated that computers are often programmed to carry out very complex tasks—as, for example, discovering proofs for mathematical theorems or playing chess—with great proficiency.
